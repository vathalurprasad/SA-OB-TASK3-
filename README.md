ðŸ“Š App Data Analysis â€“ Oasis Infobyte Internship Task
This project is a part of the Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship. The task involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of Android applications collected from the Google Play Store.

# Dataset Used
File: apps.csv

# Source: Provided by Oasis Infobyte

# Description: The dataset includes information such as app names, categories, ratings, number of installs, size, price, and more.

#  Objectives
Clean and preprocess the dataset

Analyze trends in app ratings, categories, installs, and pricing

Visualize key insights using graphs and charts

#  Key Features of the Analysis
 Data cleaning and type conversions (e.g., Installs, Price)

# Category-wise distribution of apps

 Rating analysis and outlier removal

 Free vs Paid app comparisons

 Price trends among paid apps

 Install count insights

# Libraries Used
pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

# Visualizations Include
Histogram of App Ratings

Bar chart of Top Categories

Pie chart of Free vs Paid Apps

Boxplot of Installs by Type

Histogram of Prices of Paid Apps

# How to Run
Clone the repo or open the .ipynb notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.

Ensure apps.csv is in the same directory.

Run the cells to view data processing and visualizations.

# Outcome
This EDA project demonstrates how to extract insights from structured data using Python. The skills showcased include cleaning real-world messy data, performing basic statistical analysis, and generating meaningful visualizations.
